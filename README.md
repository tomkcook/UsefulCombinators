# UsefulCombinators

This repository is a fork of coltonj96/UsefulCombinators.  The
upstream repository has a couple of issues:
* The author appears to have disappeared, with no activity on github
in the past 12 months.
* The repository has been "versioned" by creating a new folder for
each version.

This repository begins with the upstream repository's latest versions,
with all earlier versions rewritten into the version history and
correctly tagged.  The authorship and timestamp information of earlier
versions has been preserved.  I have done my best here to comply with
the license terms, preserving attribution information.

If the original author would like to become active again, they are
very welcome to make use of this repository as a starting point for
a better-versioned version of their work.
